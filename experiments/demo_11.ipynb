      "Major depression is a condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyable. It is a common mental health disorder that can significantly impact an individual's daily functioning and quality of life. In the context of the research study described, major depression is the primary focus of investigation, particularly in elderly patients aged 65 and above. The study aims to explore the effectiveness of combining antidepressant medication with a medication used in Alzheimer's Disease to improve cognitive functioning and reduce the risk of depressive symptoms returning in this population. The study emphasizes the importance of addressing cognitive impairment in late-life depression, as it is a key aspect of the illness that contributes to disability and impaired quality of life. The hypothesis is that the combination of maintenance antidepressant pharmacotherapy with donepezil will be superior to maintenance antidepressant pharmacotherapy alone in improving cognitive performance and slowing the progression of cognitive decline and functional impairment in elderly patients with major depression.\n"
