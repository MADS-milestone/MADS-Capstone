However, it is not known how patients with established mild-to-moderate heart failure (NYHA Class II), who have the additional risk of sudden death, will respond if treated with eplerenone. In this trial, eplerenone plus standard heart failure medicines is being compared to placebo plus standard heart failure medicines in terms of an additional ability to prolong life and prevent re-hospitalizations for worsening heart failure in these patients.\nThe Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) observed during its conduct of the protocol-specified second interim analysis on the 6th of May, 2010 that the efficacy of eplerenone had met the pre-specified stopping rules in the protocol. As a result of the discussion between the DSMC and the Executive Steering Committee (ESC), the ESC recommended that EMPHASIS-HF should be terminated, Based on the convincing efficacy and the consideration that it would be unethical not to offer this treatment to patients, the ESC recommended that all the patients in the trial should be transferred to open-label eplerenone. The Open Label Extension eplerenone arm will last for 12 months. Eplerenone is not currently approved for the indication studied in this patient population.\nOn May 26, 2010, further enrollment into EMPHASIS-HF was stopped.",

In the trial, subjects will participate in 4 study periods. The first period is a 16-week on-demand treatment, during which subjects will utilize BeneFIX to treat bleeding events episodically only as they occur (i.e., on-demand treatment). At the end of this period, subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 BeneFIX prophylaxis regimens: either 100 IU/kg once weekly or 50 IU/kg twice weekly, and followed for 16 weeks. At the end of this period, subjects will use on-demand treatment for 8 weeks. The purpose of this 8-week period is to mitigate the potential carry-over effect of the prior prophylaxis regimen on bleeding frequency. Following this 8-week on-demand treatment, subjects will cross-over and receive the alternate study prophylactic regimen for 16 weeks.\nThe primary endpoint is annualized number of bleeding episodes, compared between the first on-demand period and each of the prophylaxis regimens. A comparison of annualized bleeding episodes between the two prophylaxis regimens will also be performed. Subject-reported outcomes will also be collected using a patient diary. At 24 and 48 hours following the onset of each joint bleeding episode, information on pain, sleep, and work will be collected. Additional data on physical functioning will be recorded on the diary at the end of the 16-week on-demand period, and at the end of each prophylaxis period. Information on safety will also be collected.\nEach subject will participate in this study for approximately 59 weeks (15 months), including a screening period of up to 3 weeks, an initial 16-week on-demand period, two prophylaxis treatment periods of 16 weeks each, separated by an 8-week on-demand treatment period.\nA modified FIX recovery study will be performed once during each prophylaxis period.\nThe study diary will also be used by subjects to collect secondary endpoints. These endpoints, which are subject-reported outcomes, will be recorded in the diary at 24 and 48 hours following the onset of each joint bleeding episode. Additional data on physical functioning will be recorded on the diary at the end of the 16-week on-demand period, and at the end of each prophylaxis period.\nPatients will be recruited in the United States, Canada, Europe and Russia.",

The two dosage strengths of PF-04965842 and dupilumab 300 mg injected subcutaneously once every two weeks (with a loading dose of 600 mg injected on the first day) will also be evaluated relative to placebo over 16 weeks. The safety of the investigational products will be evaluated over the duration of the study. Subjects will use non-medicated emollient at least twice a day and medicated topical therapy such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors or PDE4 inhibitors, as per protocol guidance, to treat active lesions during the study. Subjects who are randomized to receive one of the two dosage strengths of PF-04965842 will also receive placebo injectable study drug every two weeks until Week 16 and then will continue on receiving only the oral study drug for 4 weeks. Subjects who are randomized to receive dupilumab injections every two weeks will also receive oral placebo to be taken once daily until Week 16 and will then continue to receive only the oral placebo for 4 weeks.
