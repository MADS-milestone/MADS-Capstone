The study design included interim futility analyses to assess the efficacy of the treatments and allowed for early stopping if deemed necessary. The study's statistical analysis involved adjusting for sokal risk group and region to provide a 95% Confidence Interval for the odds ratio, ensuring a robust evaluation of the efficacy of Bosutinib compared to Imatinib in this patient population.\n"
